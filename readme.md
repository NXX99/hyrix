# üïµÔ∏è Hyrix

Hyrix, a mod of Aroria's GoGuardian bypasser is a simple script that allows you to bypass the GoGuardian filter on your school or organization's network using iframes.

## üöÄ How to use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine and open index.html.
1. Type in the URL of the blocked website. 
2. In the below textbox, type the name of a school website.
3. Click the "Generate" button to create an iframe that displays the blocked content. This iframe is fullscreen and makes it look as if it's not blocked at all.


## How it Works
When you type in a blocked URL into the script, it generates an iframe that displays the blocked content without being detected by GoGuardian. This allows you to access websites that would otherwise be blocked by the filter.
